        <p><b>Mudhalvan</b> (translation - Chief Minister) is a 7th November 1999 Indian Tamil-language political action film produced by R. Madhesh and S. Shankar, co-written and directed by Shankar. The film stars Arjun, Manisha Koirala and Raghuvaran in lead roles, while Vadivelu and Manivannan appear in supporting roles. The film featured an award-winning soundtrack composed by A. R. Rahman, cinematography by K. V. Anand and dialogues by Sujatha. The film revolves around an ambitious TV journalist, Pughazhendi, who gets his first interview with the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. Pughazh asks hard questions, and the Chief Minister starts trembling and asks him to put his money where his mic is and become his replacement CM for a day. After initially rejecting the offer, Pugazh agrees and does such a great job on his first day, that the actual cabinet collapses and fresh elections are held, where state voters eventually elect him as their new Chief Minister. The subsequent unpopularity and jealousy that the old Chief Minister goes through results in him taking revenge on Pugazh, and how he is stopped forms the crux of the story.</p>
